    Group E and S by consecutive zeros and ones. The binary string can be then converted to a list of numbers
    S = [a0, a1, ...] where a[i] is the number of bits in ith group, notice that the first group is always ones.
    Lets assume converting S to E needs X NOT operations in total, and notice that each NOT operation removes the first
    element in the group list and will not change the value in each group. It is obvious that X should not be exceeding
    len(S) + 1. 

    Also, a double operation will append a new group or update last group's bit count.

    So we loop X from 0 to len(S)+1, then S will be converted to a new string S', if S' prime is prefix of E, then will need
    to check how many additional groups in E's suffix, because adding an additional group requires 1 NOT operation and total 
    number of additional groups should not exceed X, otherwise it is impossble.
